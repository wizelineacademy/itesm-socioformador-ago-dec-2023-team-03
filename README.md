# Wizeprompt - A simple and fast prompt for AI generators

**Wizeprompt** is a simple and fast prompt for AI generators. It is designed to be easy to use and to be used with any AI generator for Wizeline enterprise.

## Why Wizeprompt?

Wizeprompt is **easy**, **fast** and **secure**. With Wizeprompt you can:
- Ask to any LLMs any question you want, all in one place.
- Consult the history of your conversations and go back to them.
- Keep the conversations to yourself
- Manage the use and access of your teams to the LLMs

## Stack

This app is built with several technologies, including:

For the `frontend`:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): React framework for production
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript

For the `backend`:
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): A powerful, open source object-relational database system
- [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/): A SQL query builder for TypeScript
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine

**Note**: *We are considering taking advantage of Next.js capabilities to build the frontend and backend as well.*

## How will it work? ‚öôÔ∏è

1. The app is going to be connected to the LLMs (like Chatgpt or Bard) through an API. 

2. The app is going to be connected to a PostgreSQL database to store the prompts and the responses. 

3. Then, the frontend is going to be connected to the app to send the prompts and receive the responses.

4. This while the access is being controled based on your needs, budget, and use; and the use is being monitored

## Deployment üöÄ

For the **frontend** we plan to deploy this app to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) or to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/) for the backend.
