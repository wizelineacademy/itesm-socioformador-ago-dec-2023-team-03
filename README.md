## Stack

This app is built with several technologies, including:

For the `frontend`:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): React framework for production
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript

For the `backend`:
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): A powerful, open source object-relational database system
- [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/): A SQL query builder for TypeScript
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine

**Note**: *We are considering taking advantage of Next.js capabilities to use it to built the frontend and backend as well.*

## How it works? ‚öôÔ∏è

1. The app are going to be connected to the AI generator (like Chatgpt or Bard) through an API. 

2. The API is going to be connected to a PostgreSQL database to store the prompts and the responses. 

3. Then, the frontend is going to be connected to the API to send the prompts and receive the responses.

## Deployment üöÄ

For the **frontend** 2e plan to deploy this app to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) or to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/) for the backend.
